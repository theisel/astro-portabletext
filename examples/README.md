- [Type.astro](Type.astro) â€” Demonstrates handling custom Portable Text types (`node._type`) to render different components for each type, including a fallback for unknown types.

### PortableText component

- [portabletext-basic.astro](portabletext-basic.astro) â€” Provides an example of the most basic usage.
- [portabletext-mapped-type.astro](portabletext-mapped-types.astro) â€” Shows how to associate custom components to different node types.
- [portabletext-mapped-type-property.astro](portabletext-mapped-types.astro) â€” Shows how to associate custom components to different node type properties.
